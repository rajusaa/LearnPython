Printing several lines: The print() function is not just for printing one line â€“ it's a versatile tool for creating multi-line output in our Python programs.

Making spaces: Using the print() function without anything inside the parentheses will leave an empty line.

Being Quick: Triple quotes or \n can be used to print multiple lines with a single print() function call.

Using comments: We can leave little notes in our code using #, kind of like leaving breadcrumbs for others to follow
